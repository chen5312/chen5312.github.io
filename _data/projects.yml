- project: Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model
  role: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, MIMIC Database, SQL Query
  duration: Fall 2023
  url: "https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?tgif=d"
  description: - Utilized machine learning methods for predicting diabetic retinopathy in individuals with diabetes
            - Extracted relevant data from the MIMIC database for analysis
            - Conducted data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis
            - Implemented oversampling techniques to address class imbalance and developed machine learning models
            - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and calibration curve
            - Achieved outstanding results with the best model (Random Forests), reaching a cross-validation accuracy of 96% and a testing accuracy of 95.26%
            - Interpreted based on SHAP Plots
