- project: Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model
  role: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, MIMIC Database, SQL Query
  duration: Fall 2023
  url: chen5312.github.io/Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model.pdf
  description: Data pertinent to the analysis was extracted from the MIMIC database, followed by tasks including data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis. To tackle class imbalance, oversampling techniques were applied, and machine learning models were developed. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and calibration curve. The top-performing model, Random Forests, yielded exceptional results with a cross-validation accuracy of 96% and a testing accuracy of 95.26%. Interpretation was carried out based on SHAP Plots.

  description: Conducted data cleansing and exploratory data analysis, implemented diverse machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost), and constructed an API using the Flask framework. The output comprises websites featuring various tabs, with a specific tab utilizing user input to generate predictions based on the implemented machine learning models.
