        <h3>How do ARBs Differ by Breed in Heifers?</h3>
        <b>2022</b>
        <p>
            - Collaborated to observe video footage recorded by Geovision security IP cameras for a continuous period of 12 hours of 33 Holstein heifers and 9 Jersey heifers
            <br>
            - Collected data on heifers’ abnormal behaviors (ie. intersucking, oral manipulation, and tongue rolling)
            <br>
            - Aimed to provide insights to dairy farmers in terms of evaluating which type of heifer to raise by assessing how early life feed experience influences later-life behavior and welfare of dairy cattle
            <br>
            - Performed hypothesis testing to assess how heifers’ abnormal behaviors differ by breed under a short-term feeding challenge
            <br>
            - Analyzed the data through two-sample t-test and visualized statistical results by outputting bar plots
