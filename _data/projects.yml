- project: Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model
  role: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, MIMIC Database, SQL Query
  duration: Fall 2023
  url: chen5312.github.io/Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model.pdf
  description: Data pertinent to the analysis was extracted from the MIMIC database, followed by tasks including data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis. To tackle class imbalance, oversampling techniques were applied, and machine learning models were developed. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and calibration curve. The top-performing model, Random Forests, yielded exceptional results with a cross-validation accuracy of 96% and a testing accuracy of 95.26%. Interpretation was carried out based on SHAP Plots.

  description: Conducted data cleansing and exploratory data analysis, implemented diverse machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost), and constructed an API using the Flask framework. The output comprises websites featuring various tabs, with a specific tab utilizing user input to generate predictions based on the implemented machine learning models.

- project: Analysis of Temperature Anomalies
  role: Time Series Analysis, Predictive Modeling
  duration: Spring 2022
  url: "https://730241b2-c882-4d0c-b5ec-cd3b4b19de76.filesusr.com/ugd/63c7b4_531ecbccc39f40a9b7ba35feb96c2aee.pdf"
  description: Utilized time series methods to analyze a dataset comprising annual temperature anomalies spanning from 1850 to 2021 for the northern hemisphere. The primary objective was to gain insights into climate change and potential environmental issues related to temperature. Employed various techniques, including time series modeling and model selection (ARIMA), through the examination of time series plots, ACF, PACF, and residuals plots to identify the most suitable model. Validated the fitted model by forecasting temperature anomalies for the last 6 years. (Credit to my teammates -- Maria Concepcion Cruz, Lucas Choi)
