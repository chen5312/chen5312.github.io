- project: Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model
  role: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, MIMIC Database, SQL Query
  duration: Fall 2023
  url: chen5312.github.io/Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Model.pdf
  description: Data pertinent to the analysis was extracted from the MIMIC database, followed by tasks including data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis. To tackle class imbalance, oversampling techniques were applied, and machine learning models were developed. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and calibration curve. The top-performing model, Random Forests, yielded exceptional results with a cross-validation accuracy of 96% and a testing accuracy of 95.26%. Interpretation was carried out based on SHAP Plots.

  description: Conducted data cleansing and exploratory data analysis, implemented diverse machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost), and constructed an API using the Flask framework. The output comprises websites featuring various tabs, with a specific tab utilizing user input to generate predictions based on the implemented machine learning models.

  - project: Analysis of Temperature Anomalies
  role: Time Series Analysis, Predictive Modeling
  duration: Spring 2022

  description: Utilized time series methods to analyze a dataset comprising annual temperature anomalies spanning from 1850 to 2021 for the northern hemisphere. The primary objective was to gain insights into climate change and potential environmental issues related to temperature. Employed various techniques, including time series modeling and model selection (ARIMA), through the examination of time series plots, ACF, PACF, and residuals plots to identify the most suitable model. Validated the fitted model by forecasting temperature anomalies for the last 6 years. (Credit to my teammates: Maria Concepcion Cruz, Lucas Choi)

  - project: The Impact of Exercise on Depression & Analysis of Gender in Sports
  role: Application of Non-parametric Statistics
  duration: Spring 2022
  url: "https://730241b2-c882-4d0c-b5ec-cd3b4b19de76.filesusr.com/ugd/63c7b4_be6ab51d4cdd432c91373fbb2ba29f38.pdf"
  description: [Exploring the Influence of Exercise on Depression] Investigated the potential impact of physical exercise on individuals' moods. Conducted an analysis of participants' depression levels using a quantitative scale, comparing rates among different exercise groups (None - no regular exercise, Jog20 - 20 minutes of jogging per day, and Jog60 - 60 minutes of jogging per day). Employed the KW-test as the chosen statistical technique; [Evaluating the Relationship between Gender and Sports]Explored the interplay between gender and sports to determine whether they are independent or dependent variables. Utilized the permutation test for independence as the statistical method. Grateful acknowledgment to teammates Kayla Pham and Howie Huang for their contributions to the project.Conducted data cleansing and exploratory data analysis, implemented diverse machine learning models (KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost), and constructed an API using the Flask framework. The output comprises websites featuring various tabs, with a specific tab utilizing user input to generate predictions based on the implemented machine learning models.

  - project: Millennial Marketing and Research
  role: Information Disconnect, Hypothesis Testing, GenZ, Social Media for Educational Purposes
  duration: Spring 2022
  url: "https://730241b2-c882-4d0c-b5ec-cd3b4b19de76.filesusr.com/ugd/63c7b4_531ecbccc39f40a9b7ba35feb96c2aee.pdf"
  description: Explored the impact of popular social media on increasing awareness and understanding of information, focusing on the topic of orcas. Established control and treatment groups, issuing surveys to collect data. Hypothesized that the TikTok social media style is more effective than a conventional article in communicating factual information and improving awareness. Tested this hypothesis using statistical tools like the KW-test and multiple comparisons. (Credit to my teammates: Ken Hoang, Xena Zhu, Mark Zhang)
  
  - project: The Impact of Categorical Variables on the Prevalence of Byssinosis
  role: Categorical Data Analysis
  duration: Fall 2021
  url: "https://730241b2-c882-4d0c-b5ec-cd3b4b19de76.filesusr.com/ugd/63c7b4_8fa73db462aa4848b70ae1747197135f.pdf"
  description: Utilized a dataset containing the number of people who are affected with Byssinosis (Byssinosis) and those who are not (Non.Byssinosis); Interested in how/which explanatory variable affect the response variables(the prevalence of byssinosis); Explored the relationship between the response variables (Byssinosis, Non.Byssinosis) and five explanatory variables (Employment, Workspace, Smoking, Sex, Race) through various statistical tools; Performed model selection using AIC as our criterion and then using BIC to redo the process for inference; Implemented a Bonferroni Correction to test the model for evidence of non-zero coefficients; Tested our model by conducting a Wald test on our testing data (Credit to my teammates: Yuxi Jiang, Jose Lopez, Jaehyeon Park, Andrew Mai)

  - project: Analysis on Used Carsâ€™ Market
  role: Application of Statistical Data Science, Used Cars' Market
  duration: Spring 2020
  url: "https://730241b2-c882-4d0c-b5ec-cd3b4b19de76.filesusr.com/ugd/63c7b4_9ec267d5344748cd81c58398fd5ccf67.pdf"
  description: Selected 3 typical data sets from a general data set that consists 100,000 scrapped used car listings in the British market found from Kaggle; Performed data cleaning and explored how different parameters, such as transmission, mileage, fuel type, etc., influence the selling price of used cars; Used plotting tools (ie. ggplot2) and multiple linear regression to understand the relationship and contribution of car statistics to the price of used cars; Applied variable selection based on correlation matrix to identify the most influential variable in the car statistics that contribute to its price; Conducted outlier removal and analyzed the correlation between each of the car statistics; Tested on whether or not we can fit a model to predict the price of a used car(Credit to my teammates: Youjia Wang, Yuehe Wen)
